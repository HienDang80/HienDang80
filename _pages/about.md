Welcome! My full name is Hien Hoang Dang and I am incoming PhD student at University of Texas at Austin. Before that, I was a research resident at FPT Software AI Center for two years. I graduated with honor from the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Ho Chi Minh University of Science, Vietnam National University. 

Email: danghoanghien1123@gmail.com

**Research Interests**: My current research focuses on understanding "collapse" phenomena observed in deep learning architectures such as neural collapse in deep overparameterized neural networks or posterior collapse in variational autoencoders.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
